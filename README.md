A Data-Driven Exploration of Terrorism, Economy, and Fear Perception using LDA and Bayesian Models

This repository hosts the data analysis project titled "Echoes of fear" an explorative journey into the complex interplay between terrorism, economic factors, and the resulting public perception of fear. Utilizing advanced statistical models - Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Bayesian Models of Parameter Estimation , this project seeks to quantify the shadowy influence of terrorism on the collective human psyche across different economic landscapes.

  Project Objective

The primary goal of this project is to apply Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Bayesian Models of Parameter Estimation to predict the level of fear associated with terrorism in various countries, taking into account the number of terrorist attacks, the share of deaths from terrorism, and the nation's Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
