# WarCrime---fear-predictor -A Data-Driven Exploration of Terrorism, Economy, and Fear Perception

This repository hosts the data analysis project titled "Echoes of fear" an explorative journey into the complex interplay between terrorism, economic factors, and the resulting public perception of fear. Utilizing advanced statistical models, this project seeks to quantify the shadowy influence of terrorism on the collective human psyche across different economic landscapes.
